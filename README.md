# Hill_Cipher_Implementation
In this project I have implemented Hill Cipher Algorithm. 

Below are the details of this Project.

1. Problem_Statement.pdf file conveys the problem statement. Go through it first and understand the way we have implement the Hill Cipher.
   
2. User is supposed to provide the message to be encrypted in message.txt file.
  
3. The key.txt file holds the key for encryption and decryption. Where the first value represents the size of the matrix and the subsequent elements represents the elements in the matrix.
   
4. When we run the Problem_1.cpp file, it will ise the message.txt plaintext and using the key encrypts the plaintext into ciphertext. The encrypted ciphertext will be saved in the file cipher.txt.

Thank You?
